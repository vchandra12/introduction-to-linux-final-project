this is the second try as the first try just listed numbers from 1 to 50. it did not count up from 1 to 50. The first time it would just list 1 to 50 in a blink of the eye. With line of code that states the following " sleep 1 # wait for 1 second between each number"  is where the magic to me happens as it makes it count up slowly with one second intervals.
